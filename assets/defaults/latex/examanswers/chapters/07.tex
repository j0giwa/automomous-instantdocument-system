To find the area enclosed, we need to find the points of intersection between the curves. Equating the two equations, we get $x^2 + (4 - x^2) = 4$, which simplifies to $2x^2 = 0$. Thus, the curves intersect at $x = 0$. The area enclosed is given by $\int_{-2}^{2} (4 - x^2 - x^2) , dx = \int_{-2}^{2} (4 - 2x^2) , dx = \left[4x - \frac{2x^3}{3}\right]_{-2}^{2} = \frac{32}{3}$.
