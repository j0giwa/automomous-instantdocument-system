The characteristic equation for this second-order linear homogeneous differential equation is $r^2 - 5r + 6 = 0$. Factoring it, we get $(r - 2)(r - 3) = 0$, so the solutions are $r = 2$ and $r = 3$. Therefore, the general solution is $y(x) = C_1e^{2x} + C_2e^{3x}$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants.
