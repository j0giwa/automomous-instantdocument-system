To find the volume, we integrate the cross-sectional area of the region. The cross-sectional area at a particular $x$ is given by $A(x) = \pi(y_2^2 - y_1^2)$, where $y_2$ and $y_1$ are the values of the curves. Integrating from $x = 0$ to $x = 2$, we have $V = \int_{0}^{2} \pi(2x - x^2)^2 - (x^2)^2 , dx$.
